# Car Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset of car listings to extract valuable insights, such as trends in car prices, mileage, and fuel types. The data is loaded and processed using Python and popular data manipulation libraries like pandas and NumPy.

## Dataset
The dataset, `quikr_car.csv`, contains the following columns:

- **name**: The name of the car.
- **company**: The manufacturer of the car.
- **year**: The year of manufacturing.
- **Price**: The listed price of the car.
- **kms_driven**: The number of kilometers the car has been driven.
- **fuel_type**: The type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).

### Dataset Summary
- Number of rows: 892
- Number of columns: 6

## Features

### Data Cleaning
The project includes steps to clean and preprocess the dataset:
- Handling missing values.
- Converting data types (e.g., price and kilometers driven).
- Removing duplicates.

### Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Distribution of car prices.
- Average mileage for different car manufacturers.
- Frequency of fuel types.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy



## Usage
1. Place the dataset file (`quikr_car.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis and visualize the results.

## Results
The analysis provides insights such as:
- Most common car manufacturers.
- Average price for each fuel type.
- Cars with the highest and lowest mileage.
